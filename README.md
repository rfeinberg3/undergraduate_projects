# Undergraduate Projects
A collection of all notable projects that I've worked on in my undergraduate study.

* HittiteToEng:

  Utilizes an open-source transformer-based model (called NLLB), along with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to fulfill the task of translating the ancient language, Hittite, to English.
  See code implementation by uploading nllb_hittite_to_english_finetune.ipynb (Google Collab), found on our GitHub within the "HittiteCode" folder. You can also find our report/paper here:
  https://github.com/rfeinberg3/NLPFinalProject.git

* MovieTheaterDB:

  Allowed for user signup/login, which tracks many aspects of the user and movies/theaters they attended or will attend, as well as the relationships between employees/concession purchases/concession items/movie showings/theaters/customers.
  See implementation and report on our GitHub:

* KnowYourFood:

  This app displays to the user a refreshable list of random recipes pulled from the internet. The user can select diets such as vegetarian or keto to filter out recipes they may not be able to eat.

* GraphADT:

  Allows the generation of most general graphs based on the users’ specifications (excluding ones with self-loops or parallel edges).
  The program gives the user a few options to modify the graph once it’s generated. Such as delete/add an edge/vertex, return if a certain path between vertices exists or not, and return ordered traversal of the graph.
  Download the GraphADT.cpp file and an accompanying text file into the secure shell. Compile using “g++ -std=c++11 GraphADT.cpp”, and finally run using ./a.out.
